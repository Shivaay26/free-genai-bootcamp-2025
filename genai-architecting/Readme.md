## Assumtions

We are assuming that the open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k usd.

We are just going to hook up a single server in our offive to the internet and should have enough bandwidth to serve 300 students.

## Data strategy

There is concern of copyright material , so we must purchase the supply material and store them for access in our database.

## LLMS
Currently using IBM Granite as completely open source and stuff
