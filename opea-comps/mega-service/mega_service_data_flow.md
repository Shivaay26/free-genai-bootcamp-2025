# Mega-Service Data Flow Architecture

This document explains the architecture and data flow in the mega-service system, which orchestrates multiple microservices in a distributed environment.

## 1. System Overview

The mega-service acts as a central orchestrator that manages and coordinates multiple microservices. It uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based approach to define service dependencies and request flow.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 ServiceOrchestrator
The core component that manages service registration and request routing:
- Maintains a DAG of service dependencies
- Handles request scheduling and execution
- Manages service communication
- Provides monitoring and metrics collection

### 2.2 MicroService
Each microservice is defined with:
- Unique name
- Host and port configuration
- Endpoint URL
- Service type (LLM, LVM, etc.)
- Remote/local execution flag

## 3. Request Flow Process

### 3.1 Service Registration
```python
# Example service registration
dummy_service = MicroService(
    name="dummy_service",
    host=DUMMY_SERVICE_HOST_IP,
    port=DUMMY_SERVICE_PORT,
    endpoint="/health",
    use_remote_service=True,
    service_type=ServiceType.LLM
)
megaservice.add(dummy_service)
```

### 3.2 Request Handling
When a request arrives at the mega-service:

1. **Initial Request Reception**
   - Request hits the mega-service's `/process` endpoint
   - The request is passed directly to the echo service

2. **Request Scheduling**
   - The `ServiceOrchestrator.schedule()` method is called
   - Creates an async HTTP session
   - Sets up the execution DAG with the echo service
   - The request is passed to the echo service

3. **Service Communication**
   - Uses `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests
   - The echo service receives and returns the raw request body

4. **Response Processing**
   - The mega-service receives and returns the echo service response directly

### 4.1 Service Response Handling
When multiple services are involved in a request flow:

1. **Response Collection**
   - Each service's response is stored in a dictionary (`result_dict`)
   - The key is the service's name as defined in `MicroService`
   - Example structure:
   ```python
   result_dict = {
       "echo_service": "The response from our echo service",
       # Other services would appear here if we had them
       # "some_other_service": "response from other service"
   }
   ```

2. **Accessing Responses**
   - Use `result_dict.get("service_name")` to get a specific service's response
   - The service name must match exactly as defined in the `MicroService` configuration
   - If the service didn't respond or failed, the key won't exist in the dictionary

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always check if the response exists before using it
   - Return appropriate error messages if a service fails to respond
   - Example:
   ```python
   echo_response = result_dict.get("echo_service")
   if echo_response:
       return echo_response
   return {"error": "No response from echo service"}
   ```

## 4. Communication Patterns

### 4.1 Service-to-Service Communication
- Uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol
- Supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication
- Handles raw request/response body transfer for echo services
- Includes retry mechanisms for failed requests

### 4.2 Data Flow Types
1. **Echo Flow**
   - Request is passed directly to a service
   - Service returns the same content
   - Used for simple passthrough operations

2. **Sequential Flow**
   - Services are executed in a specific order
   - Output of one service feeds into the next

3. **Parallel Flow**
   - Multiple services can be executed simultaneously
   - Results are aggregated at the end

4. **Conditional Flow**
   - Services can be conditionally executed based on previous results

## 5. Monitoring and Metrics

The system includes comprehensive monitoring through:

- **Request Metrics**
  - Request latency
  - Request success/failure rates
  - Concurrent request count

- **Token Processing Metrics** (for LLM services)
  - First token latency
  - Inter-token latency
  - Token throughput

- **System Metrics**
  - Service availability
  - Connection pool usage
  - Error rates

## 6. Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling:
- Automatic retries for failed requests
- Graceful degradation for unavailable services
- Comprehensive error logging
- Client-friendly error responses

## 7. Example Implementation

Here's a complete example of how the mega-service is implemented:

```python
from comps import MicroService, ServiceOrchestrator, ServiceType
import os

class MyFirstMegaService:
    def __init__(self, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.megaservice = ServiceOrchestrator()
        self.service = None

    def add_microservice(self):
        # Register a dummy service
        dummy_service = MicroService(
            name="dummy_service",
            host=DUMMY_SERVICE_HOST_IP,
            port=DUMMY_SERVICE_PORT,
            endpoint="/health",
            use_remote_service=True,
            service_type=ServiceType.LLM
        )
        self.megaservice.add(dummy_service)

    async def handle_request(self, request: dict):
        # Handle incoming requests
        result_dict, runtime_graph = await self.megaservice.schedule(
            initial_inputs=request
        )
        return result_dict

    def start(self):
        self.add_microservice()
        print(f"ðŸš€ Starting MegaService at {self.host}:{self.port}")
        
        # Create and configure the mega service
        self.service = MicroService(
            name=self.__class__.__name__,
            service_role=ServiceRoleType.MEGASERVICE,
            host=self.host,
            port=self.port,
            endpoint="/process",
            input_datatype=dict,
            output_datatype=dict,
        )
        
        # Add route handler
        self.service.add_route("/process", self.handle_request, methods=["POST"])
```

## 8. Best Practices
